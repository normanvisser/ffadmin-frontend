# Fairfield Admin
This is a CMS for the language school I used to work for, called Fairfield College. It is a combination of bookkeeping and administration. The users are staff members of the school. 

With this app the users can keep track of the students and classes:
- New students and classes can be added
- Current student and class details can be viewed and edited
- Student details contain personal details and school specific information, like attendance and invoices
- Class details contain its teachers and students, schedule and more specifics about the class

The app was created as a portfolio project for Codaisseurs web development bootcamp. Some features aren't finished or weren't implemented at all, due to time limits. I work on it regularly as a practice for CMS creation. 

The frontend is built using JS, React and Redux.
The backend is built using NodeJS, PostgreSQL and Sequelize

## Student Overview and Details, Adding a Student
- The student overview page shows the most important details of all students
- Students/classes can be filtered and sorted
- When clicked on a student, their details show up: Personal details, attendance and school specific details
- In the overview page, the "Add Student" button reveals a form, through which a new student can be added
